This project uses uv for dependency management. That means you should use:
- `uv add <package>` for installing dependencies
- `uv run pytest` for testing
- `uv build` for building


After we are done with a new features, we: 
- Bump the version in @pyproject.toml
- Commit and push, merge to main.
- Generate a new tag
- Generate a new release via the Github cli. 
(the github action workflow will publish it to pypi)
